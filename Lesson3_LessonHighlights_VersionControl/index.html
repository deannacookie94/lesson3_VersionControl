            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system is system that allows users to track changes made to a file.  Version control systems allow users to look back at the changes that were made to a file and restore the file to an earlier point in time. Three types of version control systems are local version control systems, centralized version control systems, and distributed version control systems. Local version control systems were created because programmers had a problem with unintentionally making changes to their files. For instance, accidentally copying over a file. Once this mistake was made programmers weren’t able to undo the mistake. Local version control systems utilize a local database that records changes to a file and allows the user to track changes and recover older versions of the file, solving the issue that programmers used to face. A centralized version control system differs from a local version control system by allowing multiple users to check out files from a single server as opposed to checking out files from a local database. A distributed control system differs from a central version control system by allowing users to mirror files on their computer instead of simply checking them out.

                <span class="text-muted">Centralized Version Control System Advantages and Disadvantages</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">An advantage of centralized version control systems is that they provide transparency among users. Everyone that is part of the project is able to see what each member is doing. Another advantage is that central version control systems provide administers with a hassle free method to monitor each project contributor’s progress. Centralized version control systems provide administrators with a single location to track what project contributors are doing. This is a more efficient than assigning every project contributor a local database to work on and then monitoring every project contributor’s local database. A disadvantage of central version control systems is that they have a single point of failure. Centralized version control systems utilize a single server. If the single server goes down all project work is paused until the server is back up. If the hardware that runs the server is corrupted users risk losing all of the project files. This is also a disadvantage of local version control systems. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control System Advantages and Disadvantages</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Centralized version control systems struggle with the fact that all of a projects files can be lost if the server is corrupted. An advantage of using a distributed version control system is that if the server hosting the project files is corrupted, users won’t lose the project. This is because instead of having users check out files from the server, users copy the files from the server to their local computer. This is a beneficial feature if the server fails. In the event that the server fails, to get the project back up and running a user would simply upload the most recently updated project files from their local computer to the server. Voila! The project progress can continue with little interruption. A disadvantage associated with using distributed version control systems is the time it takes users to mirror large files from the server to their local computer.

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a distributed version control system that was created in 2005 with the goal of being a fast, simple, fully distributed, non-linear development supporting, and large data size supporting version control system. Popular companies such as Google, Twitter, Netflix and LinkedIn use Git. What makes GIT different from other version control systems? One way GIT is different from other version control systems is that GIT handles data differently than most version control systems. GIT screen shots each upload and if nothing has changed between one upload to the next GIT will link the original upload instead of creating another screen shot. Doing so helps GIT provide high-speed service to its users. The three main stages that a file in GIT can be in are committed, modified and staged. Three popular commands in GIT are “$ git add”, “$ git commit”, and “$ git push”.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Add, Git Commit, Git Push</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As previously mentioned there are three stages that a file on GIT can reside in. The three stages are committed, modified and staged. Modified files are files that have been changed since the last back up to the staging area. Modified files become staged files when the git command “$ git add” is used. Once the changed files are staged they are committed to the repository using the git command “$ git commit”. A useful git command is the command “$ git commit –a”. This command kills two birds with one stone. It adds a file to the staging area and commits the file to the repository.  After the file is committed the git command “$ git push” is used to update the remote repository. This is especially useful when working with other users on a single project.
